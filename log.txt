ACTIVITY LOG
============
19-Oct-99 Put up latest Xilinx files and Postscript Drawings produced in the following manner.
HP Paintjet XL300 driver added to Windows 95. Set to print to file. Huge schematic was broken into
numerous smaller schematics on A4 to A2 paper. A2 printed over 4 pages (you have the option in Foundation
to print over one of four pages) is still readable.
Tried originally just getting psmegaplot working (relies on cdf library) , but it wouldn't work with this
the original output giant schematic for some reason. (Produced a large .ps file, but When viewed using ghostview,
appeared on one page still).

Notes; decided to abandon harvard arch for the moment in favour of simplicity.
As the Xilinx Standard Cell for Add/Subtract has been used, Subtract is available for use in an instruction,
and an Overflow (for 2's complement arithmatic) has been added to the user status register.

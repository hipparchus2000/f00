Piranha Project

To Do List 19.10.99 
===================
2. Small State machine entered to State machine compiler.
Extend this using the HDL tool to execute all instructions-  use ABEL for now.
(State machine has been tested in the simulator).
3. Try running test program in the simulator on Xilinx Foundation.
4. Write more comprehensive test.
5. Write MicroKernel?
6. Finish current Assembler and Simulator
7. Make both GUI.

7a. Look at making the F00 superscalar.
8a. Work on F0032.
8b. Port GCC. Port and Compile Linux.
9. Work on F0064.
10. Work on Multiprocessor OS for any CPUs but particularly at the moment, for Piranha.

Additional Core items to work on:
---------------------------------
CANbus Controller
USB Controller
PCI bridge?
ISA bridge? (for PC104 type cards)
PCMCIA controller
Compact Flash interface
Serial Controller
IDE?
Graphics controller (externally similar to VGA).



To Do List 12.10.99
===================
1. Install and get running-> psmegaplot and netcdf (required by megaplot).
This is so that I can take the huge Plot priduced from the Schematic
(saved as postscript using a HP XL300 Paintjet driver, and split it up
onto my A4 printer).
Print out schematic
2. Enter State machine to State machine compiler. use ABEL for now.
3. Try running test program in the simulator on Xilinx Foundation.
4. Write more comprehensive test.
5. Write MicroKernel?
6. Finish current Assembler and Simulator
7. Make both GUI.

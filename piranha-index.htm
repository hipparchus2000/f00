Piranha Index</H1>
<U>Toolchain:</U>
<BR>At the moment, (11.10.99), unfortunately, the Freeware VHDL compiling
suite <I>Alliance </I>as referred to on the GNU site, has lousy support
for FPGAs (according to it's own help text). It doesn't do latches, or
tristate buffers.

<P>I am using, therefore, Xilinx Foundation Base Express (up to 20K gates,
or 40K when using Spartan).
<BR>There are SunOS and Windows versions available, but unfortunately (as
far as I know) no Linux Version.
<BR>It costs $400 for the Base Express version which comes complete with
cables to program your FPGA, but I understand there is a Student Licensing
program, but I have no details (see www.xilinx .com).

<P>The design has been entered using the Xilinx Schematic Editor and implemented
using Xilinx Cell Libraries. The items used (adders, shift reg) are standard.
You could load the Netlist into a PCB CAD program and make the CPU using
standard TTL parts.
<BR>The Instruction State Machine has been started using the State Machine
Diagrammatic Editor, although this will be completed in ABEL (another HDL
like VHDL), as it is unclear as to how to extend a State Machine over multiple
pages, and the pages are limited to A4 size. This is probably a blessing,
as it is fairly easy to write the state machine in ABEL. (long term this
will probably be translated into VHDL to make it more Open Standard - it's
very similar in any case).

<P>Equivalent VHDL and Verilog (and ABEL) can be created from these files,
and I this is programmed as a minor task after the CPU design is complete
(should be complete and enter testing by 18.10.99).

<P><B><U>What you get for 13,000 gates:</U></B>

<P>256 byte MMU
<BR>32 off 16 bit general purpose registers
<BR>16 bit Add/Subtract unit
<BR>16 bit shift unit
<BR>16 bit and/or/invert unit
<BR>user/supervisor mode
<BR>up to 64K thread space, (mapped onto 64K physical space).

<P>(note more bits can be added to the MMU RAM to give much bigger total
system memory size as long as 64k is okay for one thread - this is what
most windows 3.1 programs used by the way including Word6). 16 bit address
and 16 bit bus to memory. Harvard architecture rescinded to simplify initial
implementation.

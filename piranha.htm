<FONT SIZE=+0>Piranha is a spin-off from the <a href="http://f-cpu.tux.org/">Freedom CPU</a> project. Freedom
is trying to create a Pentium level GPL CPU. The Piranha hope is to fit
a 64bit variant on a Xilinx Spartan 40,000 gate FPGA. ($36 in quantity).</FONT></H2>
Project Run By: Jeff Davies (<A href="mailto:Jeff@llandre.freeserve.co.uk">Jeff@llandre.freeserve.co.uk</a>). 
Alone at the moment, but any collaboration welcome.<H2>
<FONT SIZE=+0>At the moment Piranha is 16 bit, however 32 and 64 bit versions
will be made imminently by simply making all components wider (and two
minor changes). A Virtual Memory bit will be added to the MMU and the State
Machine modified to give this capability.</FONT></H2>
<FONT SIZE=+0>As the gate count is low, and the CPU simple, one idea is
to mount the CPU on an ASIC with as much fast RAM as possible. The low
gate count should enable multiple CPUs plus seperate RAM for each CPU on
one of the forthcoming very large ASICs (100 million transistors). This
concept is called <I>Piranha School.</I> <br>Click below for more details.</FONT>
